Currently, I am a BUY Pathway student, and I am nearing the completion of my studies in PC103. Additionally, I am enrolled in an introductory course on Web and computer programming, which has further fueled my passion for pursuing higher education at BYU-Hawaii.

To provide some context and emphasize the importance of my request, let me share a few details. On June 28, 2023, I will be turning 28, and I have a family of my own, comprising my wife and two children. As I explore opportunities for personal and academic growth, it has become increasingly crucial for me to ensure that my family can accompany me on this journey. Therefore, I would like to inquire if it is possible for my wife to join me if I am admitted to BYU-Hawaii.

Now, let me clearly and firmly request detailed information regarding the application process for BYU-Hawaii. I would greatly appreciate guidance on the necessary steps, requirements, and any important deadlines. Furthermore, if there are specific considerations or provisions for applicants who wish to bring their families, I kindly ask for clarification on that matter.
